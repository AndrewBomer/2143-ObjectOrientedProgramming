# Not Done

======
Looping over Lists:

Given the following list: `[34,55,3,22,"hello","wassup",99,17.9,42]` provide more than one 
method for accessing each element (by access I mean print). 

=====
A clerk works in a store where the cost of each item is a positive integer number of dollars.
So, for example, something might cost $21, but nothing costs $9.99. In order to make change
a clerk has an unbounded number of bills in each of of the following denominations: $1, $2,
$5, $10, and $20. Write a procedure that takes two arguments, the cost of an item and the
amount paid, and prints how to make change using the smallest possible number of bills.

=====
Write a procedure that takes a string of words separated by spaces (assume no punctuation
or capitalization), together with a ”target” word, and shows the position of the target word
in the string of words. 

For example, if the string is:
```
we dont need no education we dont need no thought control no we dont
```

and the target is the word `dont` then your procedure should return the list `1, 6, 13` because
`dont` appears at the `1st, 6th, and 13th` position in the string. Your procedure should return 
`False` if the target word doesn’t appear in the string.
