## Assignment 1 - Setting up Develepment Environment
#### Due: Thursday Sep 1st by classtime.

## ADE - Academic Development Environment

Typically a `development environment` is:
>A set of processes and programming tools used to create the program or software product. 

This usually consists of a local code editor, with the libraries / frameworks downloaded and installed for your particular type of coding. In addition a local server to run code on might be necessary. What is absolutely necessary is the initial code base that your going to be working with. This is usually kept in some type of repository managed with Git or Subversion (version control software).
Ultimately you will NOT work until your environment is set up! For us in class it's similar and no less important! 


### Team Chat (25%)

The first step in doing well in any of my courses is establishing a base of communication and . Not everything can be done while we are in class. Otherwise: 
1. I would lecture,
2. give an assignment,
3. you would complete said assignment, 
4. then you would go home.

That's so highschool. Assignments will (and should) be challenging. Therefore you will need help from me and your classmates. Since the labs are only open 9-5 with limited help, we need to alleviate that problem. So we will use a chat client built for developers called [Slack](https://slack.com)<sup>2</sup>. You should have gotten an invite already from me. Accept it. If you didn't, ask me for another invite. [Here](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-users) is a getting started guide to help you use slack. Basically slack provides:

- Team chat (class members).
- Code highlighting for snippets so we can share code and read it better.
- File sharing simply by dragging and dropping.
- Private channels so you can discuss things without everyone seeing (even I can't see).
- Polls so we can vote on things (mainly for me).

So, NO email! Unless I specifically ask. Slack is your communication conduit for this class.

### Editor

Our next step is to figure out what editor we want to use. This is largely based on the type of development we are going to do. I will say this, we won't be using visual studio professoinal! It's good, but too big for our needs. Were going to use Python as our development languare, and even though Visual Studio Professional can run Python, I would like use something a little more light-weight that will still allow us to write code: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

#### What is Git?

![](https://d17oy1vhnax1f7.cloudfront.net/items/1J3p2j221s2q2q1G100T/elmah.io.apps.github.hGP6.png)

>Git is a distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) system with an emphasis on speed,data integrity,and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. Git was initially designed and developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development in 2005, and has since become the most widely adopted version control system for software development.<br><br>
As with most other distributed revision control systems, and unlike most clientâ€“server systems, every Git working directory is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking capabilities, independent of network access or a central server. Like the Linux kernel, Git is free software distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License  [[1]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)).

`Git != Github`

`Github` is a social site that allows programmers to share code with other programmers. It's also a great place to discover projects to work on, discover code to use in your own projects, and a great place to start a portfolio. Whereas `Git` is simply the revision control system that can be installed anywhere, and only used locally if that's the users choice. 

#### Why github for this course?

We will be using github this semester as a means of communicating, storing documents (assignments and programs), as well as 
a means to push your files to a central repository. So if your using a lab or personal machine, there's a centralized location that we both have access to.

#### Create a Github account. 
- When you create a Github account, you must choose a `username`. 
- This is very important to remember, because you will update the class roster with this username so I know where to find all your assignments.
- Create a repository named:
    - `2143-OOP-yourlastname`
    - replace the `yourlastname` with your last name to make it unique.
- Check the box that says: "Add a README.md file"

#### Edit the README.md 

- Edit the readme file on github and place your contact information inside along with a picture of YOU. NOT an avatar. NOT a thumbnail. But an easily identifiable picture of you.
- Your readme should include:
    - Your image
    - Your first and last name
    - Your email address
    - Your website (if you have one)

#### Make me a contributer:

- Go to your repo settings and add `rugbyprof` as a collaborater.
- You can do this in the settings of your repository. 
- This is vital as I need access to your files with edit permissions.

#### Update the Class Roster:

- Here is a link to our class roster on google docs: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wX5f7oQNqYAx6Hj1KRe35Fv28uLIAsv40_QTgXh9-LA/edit?usp=sharing

- Update the roster by adding your information to it. 

Add:

1. Your name (last, first)
2. Your email
3. Your github username<sup>*</sup>
4. A link to your 2143-OOP repository<sup>*</sup>

*Your repository name and your github username are NOT the same thing.

---

#### Rules for emailing me:

Every email must have a minimum of two items included:

- The course number and title in the subject:
    - `2143 OOP`
- Your name

I can't promise an answer if you don't provide those two pieces of information.

I cannot perform my job of assessing your work if you do not complete this assignment correctly. Therefore:
- If you don't complete it, drop the course because you will fail
- If you complete it late, you will lose 1 letter grade off of your final grade.
- If you complete it wrong, you will lose 1/2 of one letter grade off of your final grade.
- Having said that, feel free to get help from me at anytime.
