##Question 1:

#### Grayscale Class

Create a class called `GrayScaler` that will convert an rgb value to grayscale by some chosen method. Your class should expect 
an rgb value that will be represented as a `tuple` looking something like this `(128,45,100)` where the values in order are 
red,green,blue and must be between 0-255 inclusive. So `(0,0,0)` and `(255,255,255)` are ok and are black and white respectively.

Your class will store the tuple intact, and will not store the red, green, and blue seperately. Also, any calculations should NOT
destroy the original color, they should only return the grayscale version of the stored color. 

So what is gray scale? Its where you take the 3 individual parts of a color and using those values you calculate a single value that will be assigned to each of the 3 components, making it some shade of gray.
 
For example here is red: `(0,255,0)` and here is the gray scale equivalent: `(85,85,85)` (using the average method from below).

Your `GrayScaler` class is serious about its grayscalin` powers and has three methods to turn a color into its monochromatic equivalent:
- lightness
- average
- luminosity
- custom

**Lightness**

The lightness method averages the most prominent and least prominent colors: `(max(R, G, B) + min(R, G, B)) / 2`.

**Average**

The average method simply averages the values: `(R + G + B) / 3`.

**Luminosity**

This method also averages the values, but it forms a weighted average to account for human perception. Weâ€™re more sensitive to green than other colors, so green is weighted most heavily. The formula for luminosity is `0.21 * R + 0.72 * G + 0.07 * B`

**Custom**

This method allows the user to pass in three floats to act as the weights in your formula: `w1 * R + w2 * G + w3 * B`

Here is some example usage to help you determine how to design your class:

```python

myColor = (255,0,0)
grayish = GrayScaler(myColor)
gray1 = grayish.Average()
gray2 = grayish.Custom(.33,.44,.23)


grayish2 = GrayScaler() # defaults to black in the class if no color provided
grayish2.SetColor(255,192,203)
gray3 = grayish2.Luminosity()
```

```python
"""
@Description: Gets an RGB color represented as a tuple, and converts it to a 
				gray scale equivalent based on chosen method.
@Methods:
    Lightness - as described above
    Average - as described above
    Luminosity - as described above
    Custom - as described above
    SetColor - Lets user change the color originally passed in.
